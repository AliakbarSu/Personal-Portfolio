    <h1>Getting Started with Node.js</h1>
<p>Node.js is a powerful, open-source JavaScript runtime environment that is used to build fast, scalable, and efficient web applications. With Node.js, developers can write server-side code in JavaScript, making it easy to use the same language for both the front-end and back-end of an application. In this blog post, we'll take a look at how to get started with Node.js and start building your first web application.</p>
<h2>Installing Node.js</h2>
<p>Before you can start using Node.js, you need to have it installed on your computer. To do this, head over to the <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js website</a> and download the latest version of the software. Once the download is complete, simply run the installer and follow the instructions.</p>
<h2>Setting up a Project</h2>
<p>Once you have Node.js installed, you're ready to set up your first project. To do this, create a new folder for your project and navigate to it in the terminal. Then, run the following command to initialize a new Node.js project:</p>
<pre><code>npm init</code></pre>
<p>This will prompt you to enter information about your project, such as its name, version, and description. Fill in the information and then run the command. This will create a <code>package.json</code> file in your project folder, which contains all the information about your project and its dependencies.</p>
<h2>Installing Dependencies</h2>
<p>In Node.js, you can use packages and modules to add functionality to your web application. To install these packages, you use the <code>npm install</code> command, followed by the name of the package you want to install. For example, to install the popular Express web framework, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>npm install express</code></pre>
<p>This will download and install the Express package and its dependencies. You can then require the package in your code and start using it to build your web application.</p>
<h2>Creating a Server</h2>
<p>Now that you have Node.js installed and your project set up, it's time to create your first server. To do this, create a new file in your project folder, such as <code>index.js</code>, and add the following code:</p>
<pre>
    {/* <code>const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});</code> */}
</pre>
<p>This code sets up a basic Express server that listens on port 3000 and returns "Hello World!" when you visit the root URL. To start the server, run the following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>node index.js</code></pre>
<p>You can then visit <code>http://localhost:3000</code> in your web browser to see your "Hello World!" message.</p>
